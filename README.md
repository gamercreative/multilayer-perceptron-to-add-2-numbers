# Multilayer Perceptron to Add Two Numbers

Welcome to my first project in machine learning and AI! This simple implementation demonstrates the theory behind a neural network to add two numbers. Although it may seem impractical, it's a foundational step in my journey to understanding neural networks.

### Project Overview
- **Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: Standard Library only
- **Purpose**: This project is designed as a demonstration of the principles of neural networks from scratch.

### Future Plans
This is the first of many neural network models I plan to build and share. My research has shown a lack of accessible source code tackling this concept, so I aim to contribute to this area.

### Contributions
I welcome any suggestions, improvements, or feedback! Feel free to reach out or create an issue if you have ideas for enhancements.

Thanks for checking out my project!
